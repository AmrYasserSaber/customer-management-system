# Customer Invoice Management API

Welcome! This project is a Laravel-based API for managing customer and invoice data with user authorization. The API includes CRUD functionality, data filtering, pagination, and secure access control with Laravel Sanctum.

## Project Overview

This API handles three main data entities:
1. **Customers**
2. **Invoices**
3. **Users** (used for authorization purposes)

### Key Features
- CRUD operations for Customers, Invoices, and Users.
- Filtering and pagination support for customized data retrieval.
- Authorization controls to restrict data access and modification.
- API versioning setup (initially starting with "V1" for future extendability).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
1. Install [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/installation) and set up a new project.
2. Set up a local development environment using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) or similar.
3. Configure the environment variables in the `.env` file, including database settings.


### 2. API Versioning
This is versioned project with the first version implemented but can easily expand and implement other updates.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Routes
- Routes are defined based on provided screenshots. Use `api.php` to organize routes for `Customers`, `Invoices`, and `Users`.

### 2. Response Formatting
- Used **Eloquent Resources** to format JSON responses for better consistency.

### 3. CRUD Operations
- CRUD operations for Customers, Invoices, and Users:
  - **POST/PUT/PATCH** for creating and updating.
  - **DELETE** for deleting records (admin-only for user deletions).

### 4. Data Filtering and Pagination
- **Filtering**: Query parameters support filtering for fields such as name and amount. Example: `customers?name[eq]=Jamie`.
- **Pagination**: Paginate responses to handle large datasets.

### 5. Fetching Related Data
- Used the parameter `includeInvoices=true` to include a customerâ€™s invoices in a response.

### 6. Bulk Insertion
- Supports bulk insertion for invoices by accepting an array of invoice JSON objects in the request body.

## Security and Authorization

- **Laravel Sanctum**: Protected API routes and enforce access restrictions.
  - **Public Access**: View customers and invoices.
  - **User Access**: Edit customers and invoices, view other users by ID.
  - **Admin Access**: View all users and delete any user.
  
- Used `tokenCan` method for authorization checks, ensuring data protection based on user roles.
